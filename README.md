# tribute-page

Project: build a tribute page for the one and only king Ronnie Coleman, Light weights baby!!
- Using React Framework
- Want links for real pages (wikipedia, his supplement store)
- Navbar -> jumps through areas of the page no changing page
- Parts: Title, Main, Footer
    Main ->  main pic, paragraph, slider
- Slider from all the Olympia winning pics (To practoce how to make a slider kinda Netflix style but with one main pic, kinda Pump it up music picking)
- Want that the main pic switches image on click (just choose some good images of da king)

Objectives:
Practice some basic Webdev, try out sliders, play around with hovers, maybe a couple animations, and try the slider which I havent done before

Note: Build site w/o redux till seems fair to use it if project reaches that stage.
